	an at bat, and computes the trajectory of the ball.  If the ball is a 
	homer result is 1, otherwise result is zero.  Returns handiness, result.

	PickBatter picks the handiness of a batter, which 9/10 times is 'R' and
	1/10 times is 'L'.  Theta, the angle between the batted ball and the line
	between second and home, is determined.  For righties it's N(22.5,5) and
